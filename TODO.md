* Issues
    * List ones accesible ID's that are available on every page
    * Automatically register the correct position of the ID 
    * Every page should be able to show what ID's the user has
    * There hsould be a selection button to choose the ID
    * There has to be a way to name the ID
        * That should be an option to use on the smart contract
        * No we can have a name registry smart contracts that uses the identity smart contract
        * A Identity Name System uses the UIP the same way DNS uses IP
    * Need UI for users to revoke tokens
    * Need UI for users to accept tokens
    * Need UI for credential makers to set credential value
    * Need UI for adding TOKEN metadata
    * Need server application to push files to IPFS 
    * Need need way to pull files from IPFS to the UI
    * Need a web page explaining how to encrypt and decrypt using OpenPGP
* Dependencies
    * Nodejs
        * npm install -g truffle
        * npm install truffle-hdwallet-provider
